## About Meteostat

If you’re looking for climate data, there are plenty of governmental interfaces that provide open access to the weather data made available by national meteorological offices. The data provided by organizations like NOAA, DWD and Environment Canada is a valuable resource to science, education, businesses and every individual looking for weather and climate data.

However, all these interfaces use different data formats and procedures for accessing the information. It requires tremendous effort and maintenance to keep your own database of weather and climate statistics up-to-date. And that is what Meteostat is made for. Instead of running your own database, import routines and quality assurance measures you are ready to start developing weather and climate data driven applications in just a few minutes.

Get the information you need with just one HTTP request or download full data dumps by weather station. Meteostat powers everything from a small data science project to the largest universities and businesses in the world.

In contrast to most other weather-related applications and APIs, Meteostat focuses on historical weather and climate data that was actually measured on-site by weather stations around the globe. You can either retrieve raw observations of individual weather stations which are free of interpolation or use our comfortable point data to query data by geographic location.
