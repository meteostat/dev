# Contributing

This section contains information about how to contribute to the Meteostat project. It also defines general principles and concepts which serve as a foundation for the project and its architecture. The documentation covers both aspects which refer to consuming Meteostat data and guidelines on how to help Meteostat collecting and serving data.

## Get Involved

You can contribute to the following areas of the project:

* [Directory of Weather Stations](/contributing/stations.html)

## Sponsorship
